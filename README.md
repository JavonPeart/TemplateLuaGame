# Template Lua Game 

This repository serves as a template for a simple Lua game using the LÃ–VE framework.
It demonstrates basic setup for game window, required modules, player initialization,
collision handling, camera control, game update, and rendering.

You are free to use this template in any capacity but I am not responisible for any outcome 
that may result from using this package. 

Have fun :)
